This is a project assigned during IT 306 Data Structures and Algorithms course and was assigned by another group of students.
Read the phase_5.docx to understand the problem handed to us and how our group created our solution and design for the problem. An
issue we had experience for this project was time constraints, we were given only two weeks to develop the actual coding portion of the
project which would have us create a rushed and unpolished product, however I believe with the time we were given, we produced a project
that we were proud of.
